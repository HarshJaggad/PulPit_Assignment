Premium vs Standard Car Sales Classification
Problem Understanding

Car dealerships generate large volumes of sales transaction data, but often lack structured insights into what differentiates high-value (premium) sales from standard sales. Understanding these differences is important for improving sales strategies, evaluating salesperson performance, and identifying customer behaviors associated with premium transactions.
The dataset used in this project consists of completed car sales transactions along with customer demographic and sales-related information. Since the data represents post-transaction records and does not include a predefined outcome label, the problem is framed as a sales transaction classification task rather than a predictive forecasting problem.
The objective is to classify historical sales transactions into Premium and Standard categories and analyze the factors that contribute to high-value sales.

Objective
Create a meaningful target variable using business logic
Perform exploratory data analysis to identify important patterns
Engineer relevant features to capture customer and transaction behavior
Build and evaluate classification models
Interpret results to derive actionable business insights

Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of machine learning to sales transaction analysis through careful problem framing, exploratory data analysis, and explainable classification models. The emphasis on business reasoning, feature engineering, and evaluation methodology ensures that the insights derived are meaningful and actionable.
